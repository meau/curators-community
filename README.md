# Code of Conduct
1. Participants in this group have a reasonable expectation that what they share will not be discussed outside of the confines of this group, except for in the exceptional (and unlikely) circumstance where another person's safety is at stake.

2. Similarly, it will be impossible to have frank and open conversations if we are concerned that other members of our group will compete for (or poach) potential collections. If a member of a group mentions working with a donor or collection that you plan to attempt to acquire, please contact the original poster directly so that you may both make decisions about how to best protect your interests. Your professional integrity and reputation are worth way more than that collection.

3. This community does not tolerate racism, sexism, cissexism, ableism, xenophobia, classism or any other mode of behavior that belittles others or makes them believe that they are unwelcome. If someone brings attention to behavior from you that they find hurtful, remember that impact is more important than intent. Center the person being harmed and do your best to make amends directly. If you need help, call on other members of the community to help make the relationship whole. If you are harmed, we encourage you to first speak directly (off-list) with the person who has harmed you, unless you believe that there is a safety issue. 

4. We are here to help and support one another. If a call for advice goes out, please make an effort to respond and be helpful. No one knows everything, but together we know a lot!

5. Be cool, okay?

# Engagement

1. When you first join the group, send an introductory email telling us a bit about yourself, what you collect, what your current challenges are, what you love about your job, and what you're hoping to get out of this group.

2. Each Friday, there will be a "this week" thread. This is a great chance to share what you're working on, what's been hard, and what you would like help thinking about differently. Be generous sharing your experiences and insights!

3. Feel free to pipe up and send a post if you just need advice about a specific situation.

4. I also want to hear about your philosophy of practice -- are there approaches that you're developing that work really well, particularly around acquisitions? Please let us know!

5. I'm so happy you're here. We only have community if we build community, so I hope that this will be a place to participate rather than a place to lurk. There's something a bit uncomfortable about putting it all out there and knowing that there are randos reading your words who haven't reciprocated, so please only plan to join if you plan to participate.
